# Idea

Today, a large number of social networks, as well as various communication tools, limit the number of characters in a message.
For this reason, you need to *shorten* the link, so the idea for this application was born.

Also, this implementation has a strong marketing potential, where the user has complete insight into who has visited his link.
Therefore, the user can also shorten the "short" link to be able to track the visit via its shortened link.
